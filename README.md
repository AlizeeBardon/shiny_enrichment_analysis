# Shiny Enrichment Analysis

This interactive Shiny application aims to facilitate and automate the analysis of functional enrichment. This project has been carried out as part of the course Bioinformatics in Omics Sciences - NGS sequencing data analysis and annotation - [S3-UE5] with the Master BioInformatics Modeling and Statistics of the University of Rouen [METTRE LE LIEN BIMS].

This project is the result of the work of three students: Aliz√©e, Fiona and Sara.
